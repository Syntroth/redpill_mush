Welcome to the real world.

We are in the time of the fifth chosen one, still awaiting for his arrival. The 
fight between the free people of Zion and the Matrix is fiercer than ever, and 
dissidents both plugged and unplugged had formed a combatant religion as their 
last resistance force.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, the council of the last human city fights for
power, positions, and influence, tearing the government apart and leaving space
for corruption and treason. Yes, treason. For the location of Zion has been 
discovered, and hordes of Sentinels are mobilizing, aiming for a final strike 
to end the revolution.

But there is another council, one made by programs inside of The Matrix, who 
follow the Merovingian as their supreme leader and king. No one knows his real 
intention, but as the days pass, his organization grows and prepares for their 
own war.

And there are Agents, more Agents than ever. The Architect himself has deployed 
them to ensure their control and crush all the opposing factions forever.

Where is The One? Will the prophecy fulfill before it is too late? Will you 
continue your life with eyes closed, or will you stand, fight, and take the 
Red Pill?
